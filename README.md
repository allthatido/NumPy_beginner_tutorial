# A quick introduction to NumPy for beginners

## Overview ##

This is a quick and fast introduction to python's scietific library NumPy. This tutorial provides a quick way to get introduced to the various methods of the library and begin to use NumPy in your projects. We shall create a conda environment and use jupyter notebooks for this tutorial

## Packages used: ##

* [`jupyter`](http://jupyter.org/)
* [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/)

### The recommended way to get up and running: ###

## Installing Git. 

### Linux
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
```
For more options, there are instructions for installing on several different Unix flavors on the Git website, at http://git-scm.com/download/linux.

### Mac
There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.
```sh
$ git --version
```
If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

### Windows
There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to http://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically.
